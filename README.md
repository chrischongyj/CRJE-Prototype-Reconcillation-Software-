# CRJE-Prototype-Reconcillation-Software
This is a prototype made for the Accounting Innovation Challenge 2019 by team 'CRJE'. We are made up of 4 enthusiastic students who are passionate about creating revolutionary change in the audit and accountancy industry.

**How to use:**


Make sure you have Python 3.7 installed. 

Install 'tkinter' module using 'pip install tkinter'

Run 'python prototype.py'

**Future Development:**
1. To incorporate machine learning and optical character recognition to extract useful data for audit
2. Find a database service to store information (exploring permissioned blockchain like Hyperledger Fabric or simply cloud storage like MongoDB)
